                        The survey aims to provide a bird's eye view of overall patterns in the "AI assist 
                        designers" field. The work was conducted by iDV<sup>x</sup> Lab ( <a id="official-side" href="https://idvxlab.com/" target="_blank">idvxlab.com</a> ), 
                        Tongji University in 2023.  Specifically, our survey reveals three themes interpreted 
                        from the paper corpus associated with AI for design, including AI assisting designers, 
                        designers assisting AI, and characterizing designer-AI collaboration.

                        To conduct the literature review, we screened 2,574 papers in ACM Digital Library and 
                        included 93 papers in our final corpus based on the PRISMA framework. In addition to 
                        the themes we revealed, we also analyzed the corpus quantitatively to reveal the overall 
                        patterns in the "AI assist designers" field, including when and where researchers have 
                        focused their attention and what they have focused on. We believe such a bird’s eye view 
                        can help sensitize HCI researchers to the increasing breadth and depth of research in 
                        this area.

                        Finally, our survey also discussed the implications of our findings and suggested 
                        methodological proposals to guide HCI toward research and practices that center on 
                        collaborative creativity.
